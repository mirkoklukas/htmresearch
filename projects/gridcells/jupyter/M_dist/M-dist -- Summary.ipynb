    "Here we take a straight forward approach to these questions. Let $m$ be the number of $2$-dimensional grid modules and $k$ be the dimension of the space we would like to encode. To each module $M_i$, for $i=1,\\ldots,m$, we associate a basis given in terms of a non-singular matrix $B_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k\\times k}$, and an anchor $v_i \\in  \\mathbb{R}^{k}$ (without any loss of generality we can assume this to be zero). The first two columns of $B_i$ are of the form\n",
